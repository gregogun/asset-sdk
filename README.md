# Asset SDK

The asset sdk is a slightly opinionated library to manage trade-able atomic assets. A Trade-able atomic asset is data that contains a trade-able contract and meets the ANS-110 standard. 

## About Asset SDK

As a developer, I want to have the ability to create and manage data on the permaweb with a consistent program interface.   
So that if internals change or are modified, I can upgrade a libary instead of having to re-write my application logic.
